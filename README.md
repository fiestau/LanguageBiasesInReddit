# RedditBias-ICWSM2021
This repository contains the source code of the original paper ["Discovering and Categorising Language Biases in Reddit"]() accepted at the International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2021), and is part of the project [Discovering and Attesting Digital Discrimination (DADD)](http://dadd-project.org/). 

Based on this work, we created the [Language Bias Visualiser](https://xfold.github.io/WE-GenderBiasVisualisationWeb/), an interactive web-based platform that helps exploring different gender biases found in various datasets.
